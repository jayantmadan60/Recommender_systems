# Recommender_systems
Recommender systems are the systems that are designed to recommend things to the user based on many different factors. These systems predict the most likely product that the users are most likely to purchase and are of interest to. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc. use recommender systems to help their users to identify the correct product or movies for them. 
The recommender system deals with a large volume of information present by filtering the most important information based on the data provided by a user and other factors that take care of the user’s preference and interest. It finds out the match between user and item and imputes the similarities between users and items for recommendation. 
Both the users and the services provided have benefited from these kinds of systems. The quality and decision-making process has also improved through these kinds of systems.

Why the Recommendation system?
 
Benefits users in finding items of their interest.
Help item providers in delivering their items to the right user.
Identity products that are most relevant to users.
Personalized content.
Help websites to improve user engagement.


What is a good recommendation?

The one that is personalized (relevant to that user)
The one that is diverse (includes different user interests)
The one that doesn’t recommend the same items to users for the second time
The one that recommends available products


recommendation system processes data through four phases as follows-

Collection
Data collected can be explicit (ratings and comments on products) or implicit (page views, order history, etc.).

Storing
The type of data used to create recommendations can help you decide the kind of storage you should use- NoSQL database, object storage, or standard SQL database.

Analyzing
The recommender system finds items with similar user engagement data after analysis.

Filtering
This is the last step where data gets filtered to access the relevant information required to provide recommendations to the user. To enable this, you will need to choose an algorithm suiting the recommendation system.

Three very important types of recommender systems:

Content-Based Filtering

Collaborative Filtering

Hybrid Recommendation Systems




whereas association rules answer a question “What are the items that frequently appear together?” The answer to the first question can be used to recommend you products, videos, restaurants, hotels or any other content that you haven't seen previously and that have been appreciated by a group of other users with
